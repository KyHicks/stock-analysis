# Stock-Analysis using VBA
 VBA Module 2 stock analysis
## Overview of Project
The  purpose of this project is to look at all the dataset and determine how refactoring the code will compare when using it to analyze all the stock information and not just a select set of stocks.  
## Reults
Overall the stocks performed better in 2017 with  only one the TERP stock with a negative return.  In 2018 only 2 stocks that year had postive returns ENPH with a return of 81.9% and RUN with an 84% return. Also the code was able to run faster after refactoring it.  The original code ran .54 seconds with the refactored code running .13 seconds.

## Summary
There are many benefits to refactoring code.  Refactoring is more organized and cleaner which makes it easier for others to follow.  A more simple code aslso can help with debugging and easier to make changes. It also ran faster than the original code.
